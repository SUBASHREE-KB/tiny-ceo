## 🚀 HOW TO TEST

### Step 1: Verify Servers Running

**Backend should show:**
```
INFO Gemini client initialized successfully ✅
SUCCESS Tiny CEO Backend Server Running! ✅
```

**Frontend should be accessible at:**
```
http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 2: Test Complete Flow

1. **Open Browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

2. **Register New User**
   - Click "Register"
   - Email: `test@gemini.com`
   - Password: `password123`

   **Note:** The backend restarted, so the in-memory database was reset. You need to create a new account.

3. **Have a Detailed Conversation**

   The more detail you provide, the better Gemini's analysis will be!

   **Example Conversation:**

   **Message 1:**
   ```
   I want to build an AI-powered resume optimization platform for job seekers.
   It analyzes your resume against job descriptions and suggests improvements
   to increase your chances of getting interviews.
   ```

   **Message 2:**
   ```
   My target customers are mid-career professionals (5-15 years experience)
   in tech roles who are actively job searching. They're frustrated with
   getting filtered out by ATS systems and not getting interview callbacks.
   ```

   **Message 3:**
   ```
   The platform uses GPT-4 to analyze resumes and job postings, then provides
   specific recommendations on keywords to add, formatting improvements, and
   achievement rewording. It also scores your resume match percentage.
   ```

   **Message 4:**
   ```
   Pricing: $29/month for unlimited optimizations, or $9 per single resume.
   Most competitors charge $100+ for one-time consultations. Our advantage
   is instant AI-powered feedback vs waiting days for human review.
   ```

   **Message 5:**
   ```
   I'm a solo founder with $50K saved for runway. I have software engineering
   background and have built MVPs before. Looking to launch in 3 months and
   raise a $500K seed round after validation.
   ```

4. **Generate Agents**
   - Click "Create Startup Space" button
   - Wait 30-60 seconds (Gemini processing time)
   - **IMPORTANT:** This is when Gemini analyzes your conversation!

5. **Verify Gemini-Powered Insights**

   Check each section for **SPECIFIC** insights related to YOUR startup idea:

   **✅ CEO Section** should mention:

   **✅ Developer Section** should recommend:

   - Features: Resume parser, ATS analysis, job matching
   - Timeline: 3-month MVP as you mentioned

   **✅ Finance Section** should include:
   - Pricing tiers: $9 single + $29/month unlimited
   - Revenue projections based on job seeker market

   - Positioning: "AI-powered vs manual consultants"
   - Channels: LinkedIn, Reddit r/jobs, job seeker communities
   - Messaging: "Instant AI feedback vs $100 consultations"
   - Launch plan for resume platform

   **✅ Overview Section** should synthesize:
   - Executive summary of your resume optimization opportunity
   - Strengths: AI advantage, pricing, solo founder agility
   - Risks: Competition, ATS changes, user trust in AI
   - Next steps: Build MVP, beta test, validate pricing

6. **Test Agent Chat**
   - Click "Chat with CEO" (or any agent)
   - Ask: "What should I focus on first?"
   - Should get personalized response about YOUR resume platform
   - Try asking about specific concerns from your conversation

1. **Insights Mention Your Specific Product**
   - Not generic "SaaS platform"
   - Actual "resume optimization" or "job seekers"

2. **Competitors Are Real and Relevant**
   - Not "Competitor A, Competitor B"
   - Actual companies: "TopResume", "Jobscan", etc.

3. **Numbers Match Your Input**
   - Pricing: $29/month (what you said)
   - Runway: $50K (what you mentioned)
   - Timeline: 3 months (what you specified)

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Agents still showing generic insights

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you registered a NEW user (backend restarted)
2. Have a detailed 5+ message conversation
3. Be specific about your product, pricing, customers
4. Wait full 60 seconds for generation
5. Check backend logs for "Gemini completion generated successfully"

### Issue: Agent chat says "Sorry, I encountered an error"

**Check:**
1. Backend logs: `cd tiny-ceo-be && look for errors in console`
2. Gemini API key is set in `.env`
3. Network connection is working
4. Try refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Some sections are empty

**This is normal if:**
- Conversation didn't cover that area (e.g., no finance discussion)
- Gemini response was incomplete
- Network timeout occurred

**Solution:**
- Use "Regenerate" button for that specific section
- Try agent chat to ask for missing information

### Backend Not Starting?

```bash
cd tiny-ceo-be
npm start

# Should see:
# INFO Gemini client initialized successfully
# SUCCESS Tiny CEO Backend Server Running!
```

### Frontend Not Loading?

```bash
cd tiny-ceo-fe
npm run dev

# Should see:
# Local: http://localhost:5173
```
